# ‚ö° Energy Demand Forecasting for Optimal Inventory Management

> **A machine learning-based solution for smarter production planning and inventory optimization in the energy sector.**

---

## üß≠ Introduction

Organizations in the **energy and utilities sector** face recurring challenges with demand fluctuations. Stockouts lead to lost sales, while overstocking wastes resources. This project presents a **data-driven demand forecasting system** that leverages **machine learning** to optimize **inventory** and **production workflows**.

---

## üß© Problem Statement

Forecasting energy demand inaccurately leads to:

- üìâ **Stockouts**: Lost revenue and disrupted production.
- üì¶ **Excess Inventory**: Increased storage costs and resource waste.

> ‚úÖ The solution aims to build a **robust forecasting model** using **historical data** and **market signals** to provide precise energy demand predictions.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- üß† **Develop Robust Forecasting Models**  
  Implement reliable ML techniques for time series forecasting.

- üìä **Leverage Historical and Market Data**  
  Integrate historical energy consumption, market trends, and operational metrics.

- üìå **Deliver Accurate, Actionable Forecasts**  
  Empower better planning, inventory control, and cost optimization.

## üîÆ Forecasting Models Used

### üìà **Univariate Forecasting**
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**  
  Detects short-term patterns and seasonality.
  
- **Exponential Smoothing**  
  Reacts to recent data shifts while ignoring noise.

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
  Handles seasonality, trend, and autocorrelation effectively.

### üìä **Multivariate Forecasting**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**  
  Analyzes multiple predictors like weather, pricing, and usage.

- **Vector Autoregression (VAR)**  
  Captures relationships between multiple time series (e.g., demand & supply).

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
  A deep learning model ideal for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.
